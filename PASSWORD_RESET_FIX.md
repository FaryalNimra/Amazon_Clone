# Password Reset Fix

## Problem
The "Forgot Password" functionality was not working because passwords were not being updated in the backend database tables (buyers/sellers). This caused sign-in to fail with new passwords.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies in Supabase that prevented unauthenticated users from updating passwords. Since password reset happens when users are not signed in, the RLS policies blocked the password updates.

## Solution
We need to apply new RLS policies that allow password updates during the reset process.

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Run the Password Reset Policy Script
Execute the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Fix password reset for buyers table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow password reset for buyers" ON buyers;
CREATE POLICY "Allow password reset for buyers" 
ON buyers FOR UPDATE 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Fix password reset for sellers table  
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow password reset for sellers" ON sellers;
CREATE POLICY "Allow password reset for sellers" 
ON sellers FOR UPDATE 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);
```

### 2. Alternative: Run the Complete Fix Script
You can also run the complete script from `fix-password-reset-policies.sql` file.

### 3. Verify the Fix
After applying the policies, test the forgot password flow:
1. Go to sign-in page
2. Click "Forgot Password"
3. Enter an existing email
4. Set a new password
5. Try to sign in with the new password

## What the Fix Does
- **Before**: RLS policies only allowed authenticated users to update their own profiles
- **After**: New policies allow password updates during the reset process for unauthenticated users
- **Security**: The policies are still restrictive and only allow password updates

## Files Modified
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Enhanced `updatePassword` function with better error handling
- `components/ForgotPasswordModal.tsx` - Added detailed logging for debugging
- `create-tables.sql` - Added password reset policies
- `fix-password-reset-policies.sql` - Standalone fix script

## Testing
After applying the fix:
1. Check browser console for detailed logs
2. Verify password updates in the database
3. Test sign-in with new passwords
4. Ensure old passwords no longer work

## Security Note
The current implementation stores passwords as plain text. In production, implement proper password hashing using bcrypt or similar libraries.
